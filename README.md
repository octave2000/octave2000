<p align="center">
  I design and ship real products — from developer tools to deployment platforms.
  <br />
  I focus on systems that scale, stay maintainable, and are actually used.

## What I do

- Build **full-stack platforms** end to end
- Design **backend systems & APIs** meant for production
- Create **developer tools** that remove friction
- Automate **infrastructure & CI/CD**
- Work close to the database, comfortable with complexity

I’m most effective where **product, backend, and infrastructure meet**.

## Things I’ve built

**[Hubfly Space](https://hubfly.space)**
A developer-focused platform to deploy applications and databases with minimal configuration.
Designed around automation, full control, and production-grade workflows.

**[MyDBPortal](https://mydbportal.com)**
A database management platform for creating, managing, and monitoring relational databases.
Built with a focus on security, operational reliability, and developer productivity.

**[Portal Studio](https://studio.mydbportal.com)**
An internal platform to generate and manage admin dashboards and back-office tools.
Created to eliminate repetitive engineering work in SaaS products.

> These are not experiments — they are products with real architectural trade-offs.

## How I build

- Prefer **simple, explicit systems** over clever abstractions
- Treat **infrastructure as part of the product**
- Automate anything that can break
- Ship early, then harden
- Optimize for long-term maintainability
