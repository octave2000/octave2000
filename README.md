  I design and ship real products — from developer tools to deployment platforms.
  <br />
  I focus on systems that scale, stay maintainable, and are actually used.

## What I do (in practice)

- Build **full-stack platforms** end to end
- Design **backend systems & APIs** that don’t fall apart
- Create **developer tools** that reduce friction
- Automate **infrastructure & CI/CD**
- Work close to the database, not afraid of complexity

I’m most effective where **product, backend, and infrastructure meet**.

## Things I’ve built

**Hubfly Space**
A developer-focused platform to deploy applications and databases with minimal configuration.
Built with a strong focus on automation, full control, and production readiness.

**MyDBPortal**
A database management platform that simplifies creating, managing, and monitoring relational databases through a secure,
intuitive interface, focusing on developer productivity and operational reliability.

**Portal Studio**
A universal, self-hosted database management studio supporting SQL and NoSQL systems.
Designed for developers who want control without heavy enterprise tooling.

> These are not experiments — they are products with real architecture decisions.

## How I build

- Prefer **simple, explicit systems** over clever abstractions
- Treat **infrastructure as part of the product**
- Automate anything that can break
- Ship early, then harden
- Optimize for long-term maintainability
